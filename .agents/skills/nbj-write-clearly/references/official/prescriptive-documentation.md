# Prescriptive documentation

Write prescriptive documentation.

_Prescriptive_ (or _opinionated_) documentation recommends a way to achieve tasks and accomplish goals. It tells the reader what to do instead of giving them a list of options to choose from. When a goal or task is complex and involves multiple approaches or products, prescriptive documentation recommends a path.

Prescriptive writing affects several aspects of documentation:

-   **The purpose and structure of a document**. Prescriptive documentation states a clear, specific purpose. Headings and content are written with that purpose in mind.
-   **Example scenarios and procedures**. Scenarios and procedures reflect the use cases that are most likely relevant to the readers.
-   **Sample commands**. Prescriptive documentation provides commands and arguments that accomplish the task for the most common use case. For more information about documenting command-line options, see [Optional arguments in click-to-copy commands](https://developers.google.com/style/code-syntax#click-to-copy-commands).

For instance, best practice documents are typically prescriptive documents. For an example, see [Operations best practices](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations/operation-best-practices).

## Word choice for recommendations and requirements

To indicate required or optional user actions or the outcomes of a process, select an appropriate auxiliary verb—for example, _must_, _can_, or _might_. Generally avoid the word _should_. The word can create ambiguity and uncertainty for readers and is thus problematic for prescriptive documentation. For example, if you're telling the reader what to do, _should_ implies that the action is recommended but optional, which can leave the reader unsure about what to do.

To clarify what you mean, determine if an action is _required_ versus _optional_, an outcome is _expected_ versus _possible_, or a state is _actual_ versus _recommended_.

-   **If an action is required**: use _must_, or rephrase the sentence so that it's a clear imperative instruction such as "Do the following before you continue."
-   **If an action is recommended**: use _We recommend ..._ or _Google recommends ..._. You can use _should_ if a recommended action is generally recognized. For example, "You should use a strong password ..." or "You should follow the principle of least privilege ...."
-   **If an action is optional**: use _can_. For example, "You can also use approach B to solve the same problem."
-   **If an outcome is expected**: describe the outcome in terms of what is expected. For example: "The process returns 10 items."
-   **If an outcome is possible**: use _might_ or _can_. For example, "The process can take about 30 minutes."
-   **If a state is actual**: when you're describing the state of something, such as the value of a variable, avoid writing "The value should be true." Instead, clarify which of the following you mean:
    
    -   "You must set the value to true."
    -   "The server sets the value to true."
    -   "If the value is false, follow these steps to change it to true."
