# Pluralization

In general, follow the standard rules for pluralization in US English and use the regular plural form of a word in most cases. Avoid using _'s_ to form a plural to avoid confusing a plural with a possessive or contraction.

For more information, see [Contractions](https://developers.google.com/style/contractions) and [Possessives](https://developers.google.com/style/possessives).

## Singular and plural

For sentences with long or complex subjects, make sure to use either a plural or singular appropriately.

Recommended: Confirm that the number of entries listed in the directory is accurate.

Recommended: The workloads with the `app: backend` label represent the traffic source.

Not recommended: The efficiency of algorithms that process data sets depend on memory allocation.

For sentences with more than one subject being connected by _and_ or _or_, make sure to use either a plural and singular appropriately.

Recommended: The request payload and header information are logged for debugging.

Recommended: Either the API keys or service account wasn't authenticated.

Not recommended: User authentication and authorization is processed and handled by the security module.

For consistent style, use a plural after _one or more_, not a singular.

Because _one or more_ can express the possibility of one or more outcomes, it's sometimes helpful to reword the sentence for clarity.

Recommended: If one or more tests fail, a system warning is triggered.

Recommended: If any one test fails, a system warning is triggered.

See also [Plurals in parentheses](#plurals-in-parentheses).

Use a singular after _more than one_, not a plural.

Recommended: You can create more than one instance at a time.

## Plural abbreviations

In general, treat acronyms, initialisms, and other abbreviations as regular words when making them plural. Avoid using _'s_ to form the plural to help distinguish the plural form from the possessive. For more information, see [Possessives](https://developers.google.com/style/possessives).

Recommended: APIs, SKEs, and IDEs

Not recommended: API's, SKE's, and IDE's

If the acronym, initialism, or abbreviation ends in _s_, _sh_, _ch_, or _x_, then add _es_—for example, _OSes_, _DISHes_, _DCCHes_, and _BMXes_.

**Note:** Forming a plural using _'s_ can be ambiguous or confusing to readers and might cause issues in translation. For more information, see [Write for a global audience](https://developers.google.com/style/translation).

When spelling out a term, make sure that both the spelled-out term and abbreviation match, with both either being a plural or singular.

Recommended: virtual machines (VMs)

Not recommended: virtual machines (VM)

When using numbers with units of measure, use the singular when spelling out the unit if the number is one. Otherwise, use the plural form for all other numbers, including zero, decimal numbers, and numbers greater than one.

Recommended: 0 degrees

Recommended: 0.5 degrees

Recommended: 1 degree

Recommended: 15 degrees

Don't make an abbreviation plural when used as a unit with a number.

Recommended: 64 GB

Not recommended: 64 GBs

**Note:** Sometimes it can be helpful to spell out _\-bit_ or _\-byte_ terms. However, in general, it's not necessary to spell out a unit when used in combination with a specific number.

Make sure to include a space, preferably a nonbreaking space, between the number and abbreviation. For more information, see [Spaces in units of measurement](https://developers.google.com/style/units-of-measure#spaces-in-units-of-measurement).

For more information, see [Abbreviations](https://developers.google.com/style/abbreviations).

## Plural product and feature names

In general, don't form a plural or possessive for the trademark of a product, feature, or company name. For more information, see [Use trademarks only as modifiers](https://developers.google.com/style/trademarks#use-trademarks-only-as-modifiers) and [Product, feature, and company names](https://developers.google.com/style/possessives#product,-feature,-and-company-names).

In general, use singular class names. Don't manually make a singular class name plural. Doing so might cause issues in translation. Instead, add a plural noun after the class name.

Recommended: `Intent` objects and `Activity` instances

Not recommended: `Intent`s and `Activity`s

Not recommended: `Intents` and `Activities`

For more information, see [API reference code comments](https://developers.google.com/style/api-reference-comments).

## Plurals in parentheses

Don't put optional plurals in parentheses. Instead, use either a plural or singular construction and keep things consistent throughout your documentation. Choose what is most appropriate for your documentation and your audience. If it's important in a specific context to indicate both, use _one or more_.

| Recommended | Not recommended |
| --- | --- |
| To find your API key, visit the **Credentials** page. | To find your API key(s), visit the **Credentials** page. |
| The value of the parent depends on the values of its children. | The value of the parent depends on the value(s) of its child(ren). |
| You can use a physical linecard, which can contain one or more ports. | You can use a physical linecard, which can contain port(s). |
